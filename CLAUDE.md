# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Windows Forms desktop application built on .NET 10.0 (C#). Single-form app using the standard WinForms partial class pattern (designer-generated code in `Form1.Designer.cs`, custom logic in `Form1.cs`).

## Build & Run Commands

```bash
# Build
dotnet build

# Run
dotnet run

# Clean build artifacts
dotnet clean

# Restore dependencies (if any are added)
dotnet restore
```

Solution file: `wildcat-one-windows.slnx` (modern lightweight format).

## Architecture

- **Program.cs** — Entry point. Initializes the app with STA threading and launches `Form1`.
- **Form1.cs / Form1.Designer.cs** — Main (and only) form. `Designer.cs` is auto-generated by the Visual Studio form designer; hand-edit `Form1.cs` for logic.
- **Namespace**: `wildcat_one_windows`
- **No external NuGet dependencies** — uses only built-in .NET/WinForms libraries.
- **No test project** currently configured.

## Conventions

- Nullable reference types are enabled (`<Nullable>enable</Nullable>`).
- Implicit usings are enabled — no need for explicit `using System;` etc.
- Do not hand-edit `Form1.Designer.cs` unless necessary; UI layout changes should go through the designer or be carefully maintained in `InitializeComponent()`.
- `project-requirements/` contains reference images (mockups/specs).
